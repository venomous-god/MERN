    <p><b>Wikipedia</b> Internet-based encyclopedia, started in 2001, that operates under an open-source management style. It is overseen by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia uses collaborative software known as a wiki that facilitates the creation and development of articles. Although some highly publicized problems have called attention to Wikipediaâ€™s editorial process, they have done little to dampen public use of the resource, which is one of the most visited sites on the Internet.</p>

    <p><b>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
